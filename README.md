# Postfix_Calculator

This is a C++ implementation of a calculator that uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which is also known as postfix notation. In postfix
notation, operators come after the operands. Here are some examples:

Adding two numbers -> 4 6 +
Divding two numbers then adding a number -> 10 2 / 4 +
Divding two numbers then adding a number (another version) -> 4 10 2 / +
